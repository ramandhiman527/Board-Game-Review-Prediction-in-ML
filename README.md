# Board Game Review Prediction in ML
This machine learning project is about predicting the rating of board games in Python.

# Introduction
In this project, a dataset of about 82000 rows and 20 columns was given regarding the reviews of various board games available. A supervised machine learning model as then been trained and evaluated to predict the ratings given to a particular board game based on several features of the datasets.

In order to choose the machine learning algorithms best suited to make predictions of the average rating of the board games, number of regression or similar models were considered and the data has been investigated to choose the best possible models:

# Models used are :
The data set has been preprocessed and is ready to be trained. A comparison is made between 2 models :-
Linear Regression &  Random Forest Regression. 

# Steps followed are :
1. The necessary packages are imported.
2. READING THE DATA and UNDERSTANDING THE DATA.
3. PREPROCESSING THE DATA
4. VISUALIZING THE DATA
5. TRAINING THE MODEL AND COMPAIRING THEM.
6. PREDICTION

# Results :
The mean squared error of Linear regressio is 2.083
The mean squared error of Random Forest Generator is 1.609
The predicted ‘average_ratings’ are very close to the actual ‘average_ratings’. The Random Forest Regressor model has been trained well.
